## General Information

In most of the lending companies, lending loans to ‘risky’ applicants is the largest source
of financial loss (called credit loss). Credit loss is the amount of money lost by the lender
when the borrower refuses to pay or runs away with the money owed. In other words,
borrowers who default cause the largest amount of loss to the lenders. In this case, the
customers labelled as 'charged-off' are the 'defaulters'.

Perform an analysis to identify these risky loan applicants so that such loans can be reduced thereby cutting
down the amount of credit loss.

taken into consideration before granting loan amount to the applicants
